<h1>My Favourite Movies till date </h1>
<hr />
<h2> List of top 3 Movies </h2> <br />
<h3> 1. Bahubali 1 </h3>
<p> a. This movie is my favourite because of the quality of graphics due to which it 
    changed the perspective of Indian audience towards Bollywood. </p>
    <h3> 2. KGF (Kolar Gold Field)</h3>
    <p> a. This movie is all about action drama and the action scenes in this movie were beyond the imagination
        of the regular Director.  </p>
        <p> b. Yash aka (as known as) Rocky Bhai was fascinating in the lead role . </p>
        <p> c. 'GARUDA' the main lead as Villain was played by Yash's Personal Body Gaurd Ramachandra Raju </p>
        <p> d. 'Garuda' was the first big appearance of Raju on the screen and he nailed it like a king.</p> 
        <h3> 3. KGF 2 </h3>
<p> a. This movie is the sequel of the KGF in which Sanjay Dutt was in villain's lead role as "Adhira", he was
    just mind blowing in his role </p>  
<p> b. And the another big thing in the movie was the power pack role of Raveena Tondon as the Prime Minister of India "Ramika Sen"</p>
